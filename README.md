# tool-calling-test

This repository holds Python scripts to test tool calling, in particular
it is meant to be used for validation for how the Granite models will
work with the Agent mode in Continue and Granite.Code.

One type of tool calling is using functions provided by the Model
Context Protocol (NCP).
